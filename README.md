Fantasy-Football-Project---Python-Tableau

The objective of this project was to take fantasy football data for the years 2018-2021 to predict future values with machine learning. We used datasets from cbssports.com with information for different football players by the positions they play, and the fantasy points they have. The points are given per game, and per tournament season. We took these datasets, and utilized python to clean, and transform the data. Next, we had to predict future values with sklearn linear regression and export these findings into a new dataset. Lastly, we used Tableau to make visualizations of our findings, which are presented below.

Our first set of results acquired gives us predicted values for fantasy football points per game. Comparing them to the predicted values given by cbssports, we see that the data we calculated is a good reference for values that are close to the average. For those players with points on the lower, and higher ranges however. A different method of calculating future values would be better suited.

The second set of predicted values we calculated are points per tournament season. Using the values predicted by cbssports as a point of comparison. We see that our values are once again good predictors for points that fall on a range that is close to the average. For players that underperform, and those that overperform. A different method of calculating predictors is advised.
