Fantasy-Football-Project

The objective of this project was to take information from fantasy football data for the years 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021 to predict future values with the aid of machine learning. We made use of datasets from cbssports.com that include information regarding different football players by the positions they play, and the fantasy points they have. These fantasy points are given per game, and per season for the years 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021. We took these datasets, and utilized python in order to clean, and transform the data. The next step we took was to use python to predict the future values with sklearn linear regression, and export these findings into a new dataset. As our final step, we used Tableau to make vizualizations of our findings, which are presented below.

Our first set of results acquired has given us predicted values for fantasy football points for players per game. When comparing them to the predicted values given by cbssports, we can see that the data we calculated is better suited for values that are close to the value of the average. For those players with points on the lower, and higher values. A different method of calculating future values would be better suited.
