Fantasy-Football-Project

The objective of this project was to take fantasy football data for the years 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021 to predict future values with the aid of machine learning. We made use of datasets from cbssports.com with information for different football players by the positions they play, and the fantasy points they have. The points are given per game, and per tournament season. We took these datasets, and utilized python in order to clean, and transform the data. The following step was to predict the future values with sklearn linear regression and export these findings into a new dataset. Lastly, we used Tableau to make visualizations of our findings, which are presented below.

Our first set of results acquired has given us predicted values for fantasy football points for players per game. When comparing them to the predicted values given by cbssports, we can see that the data we calculated is better suited for values that are close to the average. For those players with points on the lower, and higher ranges. A different method of calculating future values would be better suited.

The second set of predicted values we calculated are for fantasy football points per tournament season. Using the values predicted by cbssports as a point of comparison. We see that our values are once again good predictors for points that fall on a range that is close to the average. For players that underperform, and those that overperform. A different method of calculating predictors is advised.
